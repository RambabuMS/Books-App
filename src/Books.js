    summary:
      "A top scientist is falsely accused of selling space technology secrets. A police inspector's misadventure with a Maldivian woman results in a fabricated espionage case. A faction within a political party capitalises on the case to bring down a government. An intelligence agency obligingly plays into the hands of vested interests to slow down India's space programme. And a complex investigation finally proves the allegations untrue.",
    info: "The staple book from the first generation of Indian Space Research Organisation engineers, about the early days under the leadership of Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan, is usually full of anecdotes by eager, unblemished minnows inching India—bolt by bolt—to the exclusive club of space-faring nations.Nambi Narayanan’s biography too would have perhaps been on similar lines but for the fact that he was at the centre of events that saw ISRO mired in its first public scandal. That has resulted in a grimy, sometimes rambling, account that’s dark, thrilling and poignant.",
